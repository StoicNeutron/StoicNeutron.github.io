			<h4>Description</h4>
			<p class="size-large">
Introducing HattApp, a native Android mobile application designed to elevate users fitness experience. With key features tailored for personalized workout routines, the app empowers users to take control of their fitness journey.
      </p>
			<p>
I started HattApp during the summer break of my sophomore year. My current skills back then were just Java programming and data structure. First, this project seems impossible at the time. However, throughout the process, I was able to acquire the skills I needed to finish this project.

			<h5>Days website</h5>
			<p>
I was responsible for the design and the development of the website. It's a simple page built with HTML and CSS. The website is a showcase website, whose objective is to present information about the app. While in the past we have listed the app's features, this time we left that up to the user to download the app and explore it themselves.

			<h4>Special mentions</h4>
			<p>
On October 6th 2020 Greg Joswiak Apple's SVP of Marketing tweeted a photo of Days Countdown app, showing the new Days widget functionality on the upcoming iOS 14, just days before it's official release. 
			<p>
			</p>
			<p>
Joswiak's tweet sparked a significant increase in App Store downloads and countless questions about the Days app. We have also received countless 5 star App reviews and feedback on how much people love the Days app and it's widget functionality.

Days was featured by Apple, as a fantastic contribution to the App store, under the tagline "Great on iOS 14”.

Micro-interaction are the delightful moments the users have while using the product. The small details can make the user experience more fun, emotional and human. Micro-interaction are events to serve different functions like communication a feedback as a result of an action, enhance sense of direct manipulation, help visualize the results of a certain action.

			<h4>The challenges</h4>
			<p>
No product development comes without any challenges or obstacles. Here are couple of interesting challenges, informations and insights: 
			</p>
		</div>


		<div class="max-width-70 text-color-black">
			<h5>Free events</h5>
			<p>
One of the main challenges has been around free events and revenue. For our first v1 release we have been sending messages to user to support the development and from where they could choose between 3 different amounts they wanted to donate and support us. 
			</p>
			<p>
In the later version we have changed the monetization and decided to limit the number events to 5. Which did result in a lot of negative feedback from our customers. As we have always kept the app ad-free, we come up with a solution that gives the user the ability to share the app with their friends in order to gain more events. So every time users run out of free events they can get 2 more events by sharing the app. 
			</p>
		</div>

			<img draggable="false" class="lazy" src="../../img/image-placeholder.png" data-src="img/Days_App_Free_Events.png">
			<noscript><img draggable="false" src="img/Days_App_Free_Events.png"></noscript>
		</div>	


		<div class="max-width-70 text-color-black">
			<h5>iCloud Backup</h5>
			<p>
Just recently we have released an update that has iCloud backup. Days never had iCloud backup and if the user has switched a phone or even just deleted the app, all the events were gone for good. I even encountered the problem myself, by replacing my iPhone and then I had to re-create all the events. We have seen a lot of negative feedback and frustration because of this.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="images">
			<img draggable="false" class="lazy" src="../../img/image-placeholder.png" data-src="img/Days_App_iCloud.png">
			<noscript><img draggable="false" src="img/Days_App_iCloud.png"></noscript>
		</div>		
		
		
		
		<div class="max-width-70 text-color-black">
			<h5>Event sizes</h5>
			<p>
Our primary and the most important screen is the event list of all events. In the latest 2.0 update we have changed the main timeline to include both upcoming and previous events. At the same time we have also increased the event size, so that the images can stand out even more. However that has resulted in some mixed customer satisfaction. On smaller iPhones the event size matters, some users even said they like to see as much events as possible without scrolling, to get that overview over all their events. 
			</p>
			<p>
For some time we have been opinionated about changing the event size. However as more customers expressed the concerns around larger event size we have decided to solve the problem. We experimented with different event sizes, but couldn't decide on how to please all users. Therefore we decided to release event size settings. Now the size of the event is customizable and users can choose between three different sizes. 
			</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="images">
			<img draggable="false" class="lazy" src="../../img/image-placeholder.png" data-src="img/Days_App_Large_Events.png">
			<noscript><img draggable="false" src="img/Days_App_Large_Events.png"></noscript>
		</div>		
		
		
		<div class="max-width-70 text-color-black">
			<h5>App use cases</h5>
			<p>
Couple of times we have been surprised by the way how customer use Days. One customer said they'd used Days to take a photo of themselves at a certain date so they could compare it in the future. Another customer is using the app for tracking wedding, bridal showers, dress delivery, bachelorette party and the wedding itself. And some are just using it for exams tracking. 
			</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="max-width-70 text-color-black">
			<h5>Waterfall vs agile</h5>
			<p>
As we are not fully committed to the app development and still do it as a side project, we have quite often fallen into the waterfall development process. Sometimes it took as months to release a feature, that we could release as an MVP in couple of weeks and then iterate from there. As some features still take months to develop due to team size limitation, we have decided to release features early, measure, iterate and improve from there.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="max-width-70 text-color-black">
			<h5>Customer feedback</h5>
			<p>
For direct customer feedback we have setup HelpScout, an email-based customer support platform. We have separate the feedback into two segments that separates problem reports and feature suggestions. Unfortunately we have sometimes received up to 5 emails per day and with Days being a side project we were unable to respond to all of them. 
One of the ideas we had, but have not build, was to create a Help Center section within the app that would have the most common QA. This would help eliminate some of the feedback. However we have not decided to pursue with the idea due to the amount of investment need and the need to hook the content with a documentation service. 
			</p>
		</div>


		<div class="max-width-70 text-color-black">
			<h4>Feedback and reviews</h4>
			<p>
Customer reviews are good indicator that users are engaged with the app. No matter how long or short a review is, user has to take the time to write a review. Both compliments and complaints are key to knowing what to improve or what are the areas that lack some functionality or cause frustrations to the user. Any review can help us understand the user needs. 
			</p>
			<p>
For direct user feedback we have setup HelpScout, an email-based customer support platform that allows our customer to send feedback from within the app. We have separated the feedback into two segmentations one reporting a problem and second suggesting a feature. 
			</p>
			<p>
Another important metrics are the App Store ratings. The app ratings are hugely beneficial for users and developers alike and are essential for the app's success. If an app has better ratings it will be considered more relevant and therefore pushed to the top of the search results, making it easier to be discovered.  
			</p>
			<p>
Overall we have <b>2,617 reviews</b> with an average rating of 4.8 out of 5.

<b>Helps in so many ways! ★★★★★</b>
<br />This app is such a help. I’ve kept track of time between medical procedures, work deadlines and even days to my retirement. That last one helps to put things in perspective!

<b>One of my favorite apps on my iPhone! ★★★★★</b>
<br />This app is simple, beautiful and very useful. It’s great to be able to see a list of things I’m looking forward to as well as building anticipation as an event nears. Please support this app by upgrading to Pro and you won’t regret it. Also, thanks to the developers for keeping the app up to date

<b>So convenient! ★★★★★</b>
<br />By far the easiest app to manage deadlines and countdowns for any upcoming events. I am tracking our wedding, the bridal shower, bridesmaids dress delivery, wedding dress delivery, bachelorette party, and of course the WEDDING! It is super easy to use! Honestly the best one that I found!:)

<b>Aesthetic Countdown ★★★★★</b>
<br />Finally we have a countdown down with a great aesthetic and exceptional design. The icon is clean so that it doesn't clutter a curated app home screen. The interface is simple and the functionality is exactly what's needed. A countdown app is useful for maintaining perspective and promoting timely planning.
