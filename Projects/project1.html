					<h4>Description</h4>
					<p class="size-large">
		Introducing HattApp, a native Android mobile application designed to elevate users fitness experience. With key features tailored for personalized workout routines, the app empowers users to take control of their fitness journey.
					</p>
					<p>
		I started HattApp during the summer break of my sophomore year. My current skills back then were just Java programming and data structure. First, this project seems impossible at the time. However, throughout the process, I was able to acquire the skills I needed to finish this project.

					<h4>Technologies and Tools</h4>
					<p>
		HattApp is a native Android mobile application built using the Android Studio Framework and written in Java and XML. I utilize Google Firebase for the Authentication and Cloud Database. The app can run locally without an internet connection after the account creation using the SQLite database.
