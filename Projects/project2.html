					<h4>Description</h4>
					<p class="size-large">
		The Attorney Request is a desktop GUI application built using Java and the Java Swing Library, designed to streamline and enhance the process for USCIS (United States Citizenship and Immigration Services) officers when requesting an attorney for immigrants. This application serves as a user-friendly tool for officers to efficiently manage and submit requests for legal assistance.
					</p>
					<p>
		Attorney Request is a class project for my CS321 (Software Engineering) taken during my Junior year. The entire project focused on the process instead of the end product such as Agile methodology and common tools that use by the industry such as git, build tool(Maven for this project), test automation, CICD, teamwork and Design for maintainability.

					<h4>Technologies and Tools</h4>
					<p>
		The Attorney_Request application is crafted using standalone Java and the Java Swing library, ensuring a robust and user-friendly desktop GUI experience. To enhance the development process and collaboration, additional tools such as Maven were employed for project management. The codebase is hosted on GitHub, serving as a remote repository for version control and seamless collaboration among team members. GitHub Workflow was implemented for continuous integration (CI), automating build and testing processes.
