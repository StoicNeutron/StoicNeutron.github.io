					<h4>Description</h4>
					<p>
					Recip.IO (also known as Recipio) was created during HoyaHacks 2024 at Georgetown University by a passionate team from George Mason University: Arman, Annekke, Sasha, and Bela. Recipio was designed with one mission in mind: to help reduce food waste. We know how frustrating it can be when you have random ingredients at home, and you're not sure what to do with them. That’s where Recipio comes in!					</p>
					<p>
					Just enter the ingredients you have on hand or upload the images of the ingredients, along with any allergies or dietary restrictions. Recipio will generate a list of recipes tailored to your needs, making it easy to whip up a delicious meal with what you've got. No more wasted groceries!					</p>

					<h4>Technologies and Tools</h4>
					<p>
						Recipio’s tech stack was designed for performance and ease of development. The frontend is built using Vite and React, ensuring a fast, modern user interface that’s responsive and easy to navigate. Vite streamlines the development process with its rapid bundling and HMR (Hot Module Replacement), making it ideal for React projects. The backend is powered by Python and Flask, providing a lightweight yet powerful server that can handle requests efficiently. Additionally, we integrated the Gemini API to enhance data accessibility, allowing Recipio to deliver accurate, real-time recipe recommendations tailored to the ingredients users have on hand. This combination of technologies ensures a smooth, reliable experience for users while reducing food waste effectively.					</p>
